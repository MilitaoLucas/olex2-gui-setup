If a cell angle is very close to - but not exactrly - 90 degrees, then this is often an indication that the Laue class is wrong. For example, the diffractometer software returned a triclinic cell when the cell is really monoclinic.
Of course, sometimes this is correct, but more often it turns out that it is not.
