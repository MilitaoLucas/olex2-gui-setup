# Hirshfeld Atom Refinement
<b>H</b>irshfeld <b>A</b>tom <b>R</b>efinement (HARt) employs non-spherical atomic scattering factors calculated from a theoretical electron density obtained from ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. This approach enables: (1) accurate localization of hydrogen atoms (equivalent to neutron diffraction methods), (2) determination of non-hydrogen anisotropic displacement parameters (ADPs), and (3) the anisotropic refinement of hydrogen atoms. HARt has now been implemented within NoSpherA2 (under the **Refine** tool tab).
