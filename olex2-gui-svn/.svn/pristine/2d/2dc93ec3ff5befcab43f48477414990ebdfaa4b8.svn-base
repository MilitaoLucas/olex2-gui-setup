p:This tutorial will teach you how to use the different 3D settings that are available on Olex2

p:In order to access the different settings go to <b>View</b> in the top tab
h:tab-view
c:spy.switch_tab_for_tutorials(view)

p:Then you need to go on the tab for <b>Stereo View</b>
h:h2-stereo-view
c:html.ItemState view-stereo-view 1

p:In this tab there are 4 different 3D options available, the first option available is Stereo colour.

p:This mode allows you to view the model in 3D via a pair of red blue glasses.

p:In order to go back to the normal 2D view click on the button marked <b>Normal View</b>
h:button-normal_view
c:gl.stereo(normal)
c:refresh

p:The next button in this tab is <b>Stereo Anaglyph</b> which enables the model to be seen by red blue glasses as well
h:button-stereo_(anaglyph)
c:gl.stereo(anaglyph)
c:refresh

p:The last button in this area is the <b>hardware</b> button which will only work if you have a 3D monitor and the glasses to go with them.
c:gl.stereo(normal)
h:button-stereo_(hardware)
c:gl.stereo(hardware)
c:refresh

p:There is one more viewing option but this one can only be used by entering in the command <c>gl.stereo(cross)</c>
c:gl.stereo(normal)
c:gl.stereo(cross)
