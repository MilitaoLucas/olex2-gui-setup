  This version of Olex2 has been through our alpha release to test new features. Now we are letting it loose on a few 
  people to see whether all things are working properly. You are welcome to to use this version, and we ask you for your 
  help: <font color='$GetVar(HtmlHighlightColour)'><b>if anything does not work, or if you observe anything unusual, please let us know</b></font>. We depend on your feedback
  at this stage of the development cycle. So please, don't be shy!
