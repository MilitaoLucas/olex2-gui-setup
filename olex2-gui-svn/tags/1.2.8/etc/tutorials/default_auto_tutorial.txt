p:Welcome to this first demo introducing you to *Olex2*. To get the most out of it, please read this text carefully and when you are done press the _Next_ button.

p:You can exit the tutorial window to move the molecule in the graphics window if you like.<br>If you would like to use the Graphical User Interface (GUI) properly, press _cancel_ and leave the tutorial.

p:Structures are loaded from the **Start** tool. The tool will be highlighted when you press _Next_.

p:To solve your crystal structure with OLEX2 you need to provide a reflection file (**name.hkl**) and an input file (name.ins) containing the crystallographic unit cell you determined during the diffraction experiment.

p:We can solve the structure of our example sucrose by typing <c>solve</c> into the graphics window or by clicking the **Solve** button. We will do this now.

p:Let's press the **Refine** button or type <c>refine</c> and refine what we've got so far.
h:btn-refine;1
c:refine

p:For every instruction that you can use in the graphics window, a short help description tells you the function and possibly switches. If you type <c>help clean</c>...
c:help clean
c:refresh

p:...the macro Clean is described in the graphics window. Let's clean once again.
c:clean

p:With the **Uiso Slider** in the **Toolbox Work** we can select all those atoms that look 'too small'

p:Refine this again...
c:refine

p:Clean...

c:refine

p:... clean it ...
c:clean

p:Let's add some hydrogen atoms to this. Type <c>hadd</c> or click on the **ADD H** button:

p:Of course, we can change the settings of the solution program.

p:We do this, by clicking the **Solution Settings** Button.
h:cbtn-solve
c:html.ItemState solve-settings 1


p:Here we can choose solution programs and settings ...
h:SET_snum_solution_PROGRAM_bg
h:SET_snum_solution_METHOD_bg

p:... set the **Formula** and can determine the **space group**.
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_FORMULA_bg
h:SET_SNUM_REFINEMENT_SPACE_GROUP_bg

p:When you click on **Suggest SG** link, or type <c>sg</c>, watch what happens in the graphics window!
